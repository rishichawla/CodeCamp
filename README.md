About the project

We have tried to obtain a solution for a shopkeeper who is getting stucked in managing his sales cum profit records and analyze them so as to find the items in his shop which are more in demand as well as profitable so as to maintain in its inventory accordingly in future.

It is basically a window which can be accessed by a shopkeeper where he can feed data of the items present in his shop such as item_name, profit earned per item, quanutity of item sold.
After completing, the entries he/she can generate a graphical representation of items v/s quantity sold (pie chart) and profit v/s item graph (horizontal bar graph).

For running the application, PostgreSQL should be runing on the port 5432
Here, we have made our app to run on port 8080
